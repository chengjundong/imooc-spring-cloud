# Learn SpringCloud
To learn SpringCloud from class [SpringCloud Finchley(M2+RELEASE+SR2)微服务实战](https://coding.imooc.com/class/187.html)  
Teacher leads us to walk through important Spring Cloud components & practice by implementing a WeChat order app.  
I write a User information service instead, generated by Swagger.

I use different external resource version with Teachers. Maybe I will run into some problem, it is okay for me to explore SpringCloud.
